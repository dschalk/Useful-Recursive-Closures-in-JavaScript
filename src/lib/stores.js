Gemini answer:
How can I make a function available to several modules in a SvelteKit application?

There are two main ways to make a function available to several modules in a SvelteKit application:

Stores:

Create a writable store in your stores directory. This store can hold the function itself or any data the function operates on.
Components can then access and use the function or data through the store API.
Lib directory:

Create a file inside your lib directory (e.g., utils.js).
Export the function from this file.
Import the function in any component or other file where you need to use it.
Here's a breakdown of both approaches:

Using Stores:

This approach is ideal when the function relies on shared state or needs to be reactive to changes.

Create a file named myFunctionStore.js inside the stores directory.
Inside the file, define a writable store with the function:
JavaScript
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

export const myFunctionStore = writable((data) => {
    // Your function logic here
    return processedData;
});
Use code with caution.
In your components, import and use the store:
JavaScript
import { myFunctionStore } from '../stores/myFunctionStore';

function MyComponent() {
    const processedData = myFunctionStore(rawData);
    // Use processedData
}
Use code with caution.
Using Lib Directory:

This approach is simpler for utility functions that don't rely on shared state.

Create a file named utils.js inside the lib directory.
Define your function inside the file:
JavaScript
export function myFunction(data) {
    // Your function logic here
    return processedData;
}
Use code with caution.
In your components or other files, import and use the function:
JavaScript
import { myFunction } from '$lib/utils';

function MyComponent() {
    const processedData = myFunction(rawData);
    // Use processedData
}
Use code with caution.
Choose the approach that best suits your function's purpose and data dependencies. Stores offer more control over reactivity and shared state, while the lib directory provides a simpler way to share utility functions.
