<p class="p2">Do the Bell inequality experiments really rule out the existence of hidden variables in entangled particles?</p>

<p> Merlin: Yes, the Bell inequality experiments provide compelling evidence against local hidden variables in the behavior of entangled particles. The Bell's theorem states that certain predictions of quantum mechanics are inconsistent with the concept of local hidden variables.

</p><p>
Hidden variables theories propose that quantum uncertainties are due to some underlying "hidden" variables or information not currently accessible to us. If such hidden variables exist, they should follow Bell's inequalities.

</p><p>
However, in various experiments that have been performed, the results often violate Bell’s inequalities, meaning a key prediction of local hidden variables theories is not observed. This demonstrates that local hidden variable theories are incompatible with the predictions of quantum physics for entangled particles.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to note that these results do not rule out non-local hidden variables theories, where the properties of one particle can instantaneously influence the properties of an entangled partner, regardless of distance, but such theories would defy our usual notions of space and time.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, while Bell's theorem and subsequent experiments have decidedly ruled out local hidden variables, they have not invalidated the possibility of non-local hidden variable theories. The search for a complete understanding of quantum mechanics thus continues. </p>

<p class="p2"> Why do violations of Bell's inequality disprove the existence of hidden variables in entangled particles? </p>

<p> Merlin: Violations of Bell's inequality disprove the existence of local hidden variables in entangled particles due to the fundamental assumptions behind the inequality.

</p><p>
John Bell proposed these inequalities based on the concept of local realism, the idea that physical processes occurring at one location do not depend on the properties of objects at other locations (locality), and physical quantities have definite values even before they are measured (realism). Essentially, these are fundamental postulates of hidden variable theories.

</p><p>
The derivation of Bell's Inequalities assumed that two entangled particles could be described by local hidden variables that determine the outcomes of all possible measurements on the particles. If this were true, the correlations between measurements on the two particles should follow certain constraints defined by Bell's inequalities.

</p><p>
However, quantum mechanics, through experiments involving entangled particles, routinely reports correlations that violate Bell's inequalities. This violation indicates that the outcomes of measurements on the particles are not solely determined by local hidden variables, implying one or both aspects of local realism must be untrue.

</p><p>
    
In other words, Bell's theorem doesn't refute the concept of hidden variables entirely but rather the notion of local hidden variables. Non-local hidden variables could still exist, but their implementation would imply a departure from our usual concepts of space and time as they would need to affect outcomes instantaneously over any distance. That's why they are typically considered somewhat more exotic and less likely in mainstream physics. </p>
<p style="p2">Show me some example experiments demonstrating violations of Bell's, along with the reasoning involved in drawing conclusions.</p>

<p>Merlin: Here's a simplified version of how physicists demonstrate violations of Bell’s inequality in an experiment involving entangled particles.

<h3>
    Experiment: Aspect's Bell Test Experiments
</h3>

<p>
    Alain Aspect and his colleagues' experiments in the early 1980s are some of the most iconic. They used pairs of entangled photons emitted by a calcium cascade source and sent the photos in different directions.
      
</p><p>
    
    The directions of the polarization of these entangled photons were measured at two different locations, which were sufficiently far apart that no information could be exchanged between them at the speed of light or less in the time it took to do the measurements.
    
</p><p>
    
    According to quantum mechanics, the correlated polarizations of the entangled pair are not determined until one of the photons is measured. But according to local realism (which includes local hidden variables), the photon's polarization direction should've been set at the time of their separation.
    
</p><h3>
    
    Results and Reasoning:
    
</h3>

<p>
    Aspect's experiments showed that the correlation of the polarizations measured were much stronger than any local hidden variable theory would allow, as defined by Bell’s inequalities.
    
</p><p>
    
 
    This can be interpreted in two ways:
    
    The act of measuring one photon 'instantaneously' determines the result of measuring the other, no matter the distance between the two. This is called quantum entanglement and is compatible with quantum mechanics, but it does contradict the principle of locality, the idea that an object is only influenced by its immediate surroundings.
    
</p><p>
    
    If you want to stick with locality and realism principles, you have to consider non-local hidden variables, which are entities affecting the outcome of the measurements that are not confined to the speed of light.
    
</p><p>
    
    These experiments still do not absolutely confirm quantum mechanics nor absolutely reject all alternative explanations — it's always possible to question the underlying assumptions (like locality and realism).
    
</p><p>
    
    What's significant though is that these experiments show quantum mechanics is not classical, and while we cannot definitively rule out all other interpretations, quantum mechanics has proven exceptionally successful in predicting experimental outcomes.
</p>
<p state="p2"> 
    What is the currently most widely accepted explanation of the Bell inequality experimental results?    
</p>


<p>
    The most widely accepted explanation of the Bell inequality experimental results is the quantum mechanical interpretation, specifically the Copenhagen interpretation.

    The Copenhagen interpretation postulates that particles do not have definite states until they are measured. This interpretation abandons the principle of realism (that particles have definite properties between measurements), embracing instead the strange, counter-intuitive nature of quantum mechanics.
    
    In the context of the Bell inequality, the Copenhagen interpretation explains the experimental results by asserting that the properties of entangled particles are not determined until they are measured. Until the measurement, the particles exist in a superposition of states. When a measurement is made on one of the entangled particles, it instantaneously collapses into a definite state, and the other particle, even if far away, also collapses into a correlated state, thus preserving quantum entanglement.
    
    The Copenhagen interpretation, however, stands in apparent conflict with Einstein's special theory of relativity, which postulates that information cannot be transmitted faster than the speed of light. This "spooky action at a distance"—as Einstein termed quantum entanglement—remains one of the most mysterious facets of quantum mechanics, and the heart of a still-open debate about the interpretation and completeness of quantum theory.
