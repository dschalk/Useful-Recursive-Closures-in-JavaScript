<h2>Useful Recursive Closures</h2>

<p>Recursive functions returned by the simple M(x) function (no restrictions on what x can be) form closures with M that facilitate elegant function composition, sequestering state transformations inside the closure's scope, and more. A demonstration features a solitaire version of the simulated four-dice game of Score controlled inside the closure "m2 = M(x)", where x = [ [], [], [], [], [], [], [],[] ].</p>
