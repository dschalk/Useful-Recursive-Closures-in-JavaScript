<p class="p2">Do the Bell inequality experiments really rule out the existence of hidden variables in entangled particles?</p>

<p>
    Pilot Wave Theory, also known as the de Broglie-Bohm theory or Bohmian mechanics, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics. It proposes that in addition to the wave function of quantum entities, an actual configuration of particles exists, even when they're unobserved. The movement over time of these particles is directed by what's known as a guiding equation.
</p>

<p>
    This theory is said to be deterministic and distinctly nonlocal, which means that the velocity of any particle depends on the configuration of all particles under consideration. This view contrasts with the standard Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which poses that particles do not have specific locations until they are observed.
</p>

<p>
    One major pillar of pilot wave theory is the principle of quantum equilibrium, according to which configurations of particles are distributed according to the square magnitude of the wave function.
</p>

 <p>   
    Notable for this theory is it does not suffer from the "measurement problem," given that particles have specific configurations at all times. It was first developed in the 1920s by Louis de Broglie, and later rediscovered and extended by David Bohm in the 1950s. While not as widely regarded as some other interpretations of quantum mechanics, the pilot wave theory still holds its position in quantum mechanics as it offers a deterministic, non-subjective framework of the quantum domain.

<p class="p2">
Are pilot wave theory, De Brogile-Bohm theory, and Bohmian Mechanics different names for the same thing, or are there differences among them?
</p>
<p>
    Pilot Wave Theory, De Broglie-Bohm Theory, and Bohmian Mechanics are all different names for the same theory regarding quantum mechanics. The names reflect the significant contributors to the theory.

    Originally proposed by Louis de Broglie in the 1920s, the theory was largely overlooked until it was rediscovered and extended by David Bohm in the 1950s. Therefore, people sometimes refer to it as the De Broglie-Bohm Theory or Bohmian Mechanics. The term "Pilot Wave Theory" derives from the concept that particles are guided by a "pilot wave," a key idea in this interpretation of quantum physics.  
</p>


<p class="p2">
    Do any facts or experimental data help in evaluating the probable validity of the Copenhegen interpretation vis-Ã -vis Bohmian Mechanics?
</p>

<p>
Both the Copenhagen interpretation and Bohmian Mechanics (Pilot Wave Theory) are interpretations of quantum mechanics, so they are both consistent with all experimental data available, because they are built to be in line with quantum phenomena. However, they explain the quantum phenomena differently from a conceptual or philosophical perspective, so their validity or plausibility may be seen as a more subjective realm depending largely on one's philosophical inclination or interpretation of quantum behavior.
</p>

<p>

The Copenhagen Interpretation emphasizes probabilities and states that particles don't have definite properties until measured, while Bohmian Mechanics asserts that particles have precise positions at all times and their movement is guided by a 'pilot wave'. It discards the probabilistic wave collapse concept often associated with the Copenhagen interpretation.

</p>

<p>

Since quantum mechanics is extremely successful in predicting experimental outcomes, any interpretation that correctly reproduces the predictions of quantum mechanics will not be contradictory to experimental data. Therefore, deciding which interpretation is 'correct', Copenhagen or Bohmian, becomes a matter of philosophical preference rather than one of empirical science.

</p>

<p>
Experimental tests that can clearly distinguish between these interpretations are challenging to conduct, due to the 'equivalent predictions' problem. However, the development of quantum technologies might lead in the future to an increased understanding of quantum mechanics and potentially reveal more discrepancies among the interpretations. Until that time, the choice between the Copenhagen interpretation and Bohmian Mechanics is essentially subjective and dependent on the individual physicist's preference for a deterministic (Bohmian) or indeterministic (Copenhagen) picture of the quantum world.
