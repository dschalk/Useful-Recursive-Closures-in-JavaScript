<p>The recursive closures file is <a href="${"./monads"}">here</a>. It&#39;s on the right in the menu, titled &quot;Monads.&quot; I bagan the &quot;Monads&quot; module (this is a SvelteKit application) with this: &quot;JavaScript monads are defined in various ways online and in print. I wouldn&#39;t say any of these definitions are right or wrong. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. Some of my thoughts on the matter will be in Home and in an addendum.&quot; So I&#39;ll begin with some information and musings on the word &quot;monad.&quot;</p>`;
